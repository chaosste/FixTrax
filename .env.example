# Note: API keys are NOT stored in .env for security
# They are managed server-side by the proxy service
# This prevents exposure of sensitive credentials in client-side code
# See DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md for details on proxy architecture

# Development server runs on http://localhost:3000
# Production Docker deployment runs on port 8080

# Build ID (used in AI prompts for version tracking)
